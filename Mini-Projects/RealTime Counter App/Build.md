3. Break Down the Counter App Requirements
Plan these features:
- [x] WebSocket server setup
- [x] Counter state management 
- [x] Client connections handling
- [x] UI for increment/decrement
- [x] Real-time updates across browsers

4. Implementation Order
- Create basic server structure
- Set up simple HTML client
- Implement WebSocket connection 
- Add counter functionality
- Test with multiple browsers

5. Practice Exercises
After completing the basic counter:

Add these features one by one:
- User count display
- Connection status indicator
- Reconnection logic
- Basic error handling

6. Testing
- Test across different browsers
- Test with multiple users
- Test disconnection scenarios
- Test error cases

7. Documentation
- Document your code
- Note challenges faced
- List lessons learned
- Save code for future reference

Success Criteria:
- Counter syncs across multiple browsers
- All connected users see real-time updates
- Clean, working code
- Basic error handling
- Understanding of WebSocket concepts


A real-time counter app is a web application where multiple users can interact with a shared counter simultaneously, and all users see the changes instantly without refreshing their browsers.

Key Characteristics:
1. Shared State
One counter value shared across all connected users
Changes made by any user are visible to everyone

2. Real-time Updates
Uses WebSocket connections for instant communication
No page refresh needed - updates happen live
Typically sub-second response time

3. Multi-user Interaction
Multiple people can increment/decrement simultaneously
Shows number of connected users
Handles concurrent operations

Common Features:
Increment/Decrement buttons (+/-)
Live counter display (updates in real-time)
Connected users count
Connection status indicator
Simple, clean UI

How It Works:
Server maintains the counter state
WebSocket connection between each client and server
When user clicks +/-, message sent to server
Server updates counter and broadcasts to all clients
All browsers update their display instantly
